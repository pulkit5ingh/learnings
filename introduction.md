### Introduction

"Hi, I’m Pulkit Singh, a Senior Backend Engineer with over four years of experience specializing in building scalable, high-performance backend systems. I hold a Master of Computer Applications from the Institute Of Science and Technology and have worked with companies like Corpusvision Technologies and DandD Tech USA, where I developed a wide range of projects in industries like travel, foodtech, and healthcare.

In my current role, I’ve engineered backend APIs using Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and NestJS, while also implementing secure authentication systems, building robust reporting tools, and integrating third-party services like Twilio for SMS notifications and AWS S3 for media storage. I have extensive experience with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS and DigitalOcean.

1. Here’s the updated **Tripinnov** project description with the latest details:

1. **Tripinnov (https://www.tripinnov.com)**
   Tripinnov is a multi-tenant, multi-portal travel platform designed for travel agents to create and sell travel quotations on the go. This platform operates on a subscription and commission-based model. My role involved gathering requirements from the client, planning the project structure, designing the API architecture, and developing the backend using **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**, with **REST APIs** for service communication.

   I handled the design of the database schemas, API structure, testing, and development, ensuring a scalable system. For authentication and authorization, we implemented **JWT** and **PassportJS** for token-based security, coupled with a dynamically configurable **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) system, enabling granular permission control across different user roles.

   We used **Swagger** for comprehensive API documentation, making it easy for developers and stakeholders to understand and interact with the system. The frontend was built using **Next.js**, **React.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, managed with a monorepo structure through **Turborepo** for efficient development.

   For version control, we used **Git** and **GitHub**, while **CI/CD pipelines** were set up via **GitHub Actions** to ensure smooth, automated deployments and continuous integration. This setup enabled robust, real-time data interaction and seamless travel quotation management for agents.
