### Advanced JavaScript coding interview questions

1. Implement a debounce function in JavaScript that limits the frequency of a function’s execution when it’s called repeatedly within a specified time frame.

2. Write a function that takes an array of objects and a key, and returns a new array sorted based on the values of that key in ascending order.

3. Implement a deep clone function in JavaScript that creates a copy of a nested object or array without any reference to the original.

4. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

5. Implement a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.

6. Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.

7. Create a JavaScript class for a linked list with methods to insert a node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position, and to delete a node from a given position.

8. Implement a function that flattens a nested array in JavaScript, converting it into a single-level array.

9. Write a function that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other

10. Create a JavaScript function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number, utilizing memoization for optimized performance.

### Common JavaScript coding interview questions

1. Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

2. Implement a function to reverse a string without using the built-in reverse() method.

3. Given an array of numbers, write a function to find the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

4. Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with only the unique elements.

5. Implement a function to find the factorial of a given number.

6. Write a function that determines if a given number is prime or not.

7. Implement a function to find the sum of all the numbers in an array.

8. Given a string, write a function to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

9. Implement a function to remove duplicates from an array.

10. Write a function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.

### Tricky JavaScript coding questions

1. Write a function that reverses the order of words in a sentence without using the built-in reverse() method

2. Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) while ignoring whitespace and punctuation.

3. Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the array.

4. Implement a function that removes duplicates from an array, keeping only the unique elements.

5. Write a function that accepts a number and returns its factorial (e.g., factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1).

6. Implement a function that flattens a nested array into a single-dimensional array.

7. Write a function that checks if a given string is an anagram of another string (contains the same characters in a different order).

8. Implement a function that finds the second smallest element in an array of integers.

9. Write a function that generates a random alphanumeric string of a given length.

10. Implement a function that converts a number to its Roman numeral representation.

### JavaScript array coding questions

1. Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in an array.

2. Implement a function that finds the maximum number in an array.

3. Write a function that returns a new array containing only the unique elements from an input array.

4. Implement a function that returns the average value of numbers in an array.

5. Write a function that sorts an array of strings in alphabetical order.

6. Implement a function that finds the index of a specific element in an array. If the element is not found, the function should return -1.

7. Write a function that removes all falsy values (false, null, 0, “”, undefined, and NaN) from an array.

8. Implement a function that merges two arrays into a single array, alternating elements from each array.

9. Write a function that finds the second largest number in an array

10. Implement a function that groups elements in an array based on a given condition. For example, grouping even and odd numbers into separate arrays.
