1) What are Relational Databases

- A relational database (RDB) is a type of database that organizes data into tables, rows, and columns to establish relationships between data points. This structure makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationships between different data points.

3) RDBMS advantanges and limitations.

    - advantages :-

        1. Data structure - They organize data into tables with rows and columns, providing a structured and consistent way to store and manage data. This structure facilitates easy access, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

        2. Data Integrity - They enforce data integrity through constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints. These constraints ensure that the data remains accurate and consistent, preventing the introduction of duplicate or invalid information.

        3. Data Relationships - They enable the establishment of relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys. This feature allows data from different tables to be linked together, making it easier to query and analyze related information.

        4. Querying and Reporting - They provide powerful query languages (e.g., SQL) that allow users to retrieve specific data from the database quickly. This simplicity and flexibility make it easier to generate reports and gain insights from the data.

        5. Data Security - They offer robust security mechanisms to protect sensitive data. Access control features allow administrators to define user permissions and restrict unauthorized access to data.

        6. Scalability - They can handle large amounts of data and scale up to accommodate the growth of the dataset and user demand. Many RDBMS platforms offer high-availability options and clustering to ensure system availability even during peak usage.

        7. ACID Transactions - They support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which guarantee that database operations are reliable and that data remains in a consistent state even in the event of failures.

        8. Data Backup and Recovery - They provide tools and mechanisms to perform regular backups of the database, enabling data recovery in case of hardware failures, accidental deletions, or other unforeseen issues.

        9. Data Indexing - They use indexing techniques to optimize data retrieval. Indexes speed up query execution by reducing the need for full-table scans, especially for large datasets.

        10. Data Normalization - They encourage data normalization, which helps eliminate data redundancy and inconsistencies. Normalized data ensures efficient storage and minimizes update anomalies.

        11. Industry Standard - RDBMS, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, have been around for decades and have established themselves as reliable, widely used, and well-supported solutions.

        12. Data Consistency - They enforce referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between data remain consistent. This prevents data inconsistencies and maintains the accuracy and reliability of the information stored in the database.

        13. Data Independence - They offer data abstraction, separating the logical structure of the database from its physical implementation. This data independence allows developers to modify the database schema without affecting the applications built on top of it, promoting flexibility and reducing maintenance efforts.

        14. Data Accessibility - They provide concurrent access to multiple users and applications. Users can read and write data simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s operations, promoting efficient collaboration and multi-user support.

        15. Data Backup and Recovery - They typically offer various backup and recovery options, including full, incremental, and differential backups. These features ensure data protection and the ability to restore the database to a specific point in time.
