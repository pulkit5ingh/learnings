Dear Yash,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing the exciting opportunity at AkquaintX. After reviewing your detailed description of the role and the innovative vision behind the platform, I am truly inspired by the potential AkquaintX holds in redefining professional networking by integrating market research and community-building.

With near 5 years of experience in technical leadership and backend development, I have led the successful launch of multiple platforms and applications, from inception to scale. My expertise lies in leading and architecting scalable backend infrastructures, driving product innovation, and integrating complex data analytics tools—all of which I believe are crucial to the vision of AkquaintX.

Some key projects I have led include:

   • Led a team of 3 developers.
   • Platform has more than 2,000 regular users and over 400 registered merchants.

3. FliqaIndia https://fliqaindia.com/
   • One of the core founding members and equity holder, serving as CTO and tech lead.
   • Conducted multiple rounds of interviews, selecting UI developers, full-stack developers, and other team members.

   • Contributed valuable ideas and feedback, leading to rapid growth with monthly revenue increasing from 50k to over 2 lakhs.
   • Helped the company has more than 2,000 reviews with an average rating of 4.9.

In addition to these projects, I have also led several other initiatives that have further honed my skills in building robust technology solutions.
