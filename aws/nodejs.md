### 1) Create t2.small instance with RSA key to access server appNameRSAKey

### 2) Create RSA to access server

- RSA stands for Rivest–Shamir–Adleman, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who introduced the algorithm in 1977. It is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.

- Key Concepts

RSA involves generating two keys:

Public Key: Used to encrypt data. This key can be shared with anyone.
Private Key: Used to decrypt data. This key is kept secret.

Why Use RSA?

RSA is widely used in cryptographic protocols to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, making it a cornerstone of modern security systems.

### 3) New instance will be having a dynamic ip so create a new elastic IP and associate it with the instance

### 4)
