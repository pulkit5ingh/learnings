# Docker Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

## Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environments, making them ideal for both development and production.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the essential Docker commands with practical examples. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Docker to manage your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the command line.
- Node.js installed on your machine (for Node.js examples).

## Basics

Before diving into the commands, let's cover the basic concepts:

- Dockerfile: A script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
- Images: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- Containers: Running instances of Docker images.
- Volumes: Persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

## 1. Installing Docker

### On Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

### On macOS

Use Homebrew to install Docker:

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

### On Windows

Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### 2.1. Docker Version

Check your Docker installation:

```bash
docker --help // To get help from docker
docker --version // To display the current installed Docker version.
```

### 2.2. Running Your First Container

Run a basic hello-world container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container.

### 2.3. Listing Running Containers

View all running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

View all containers (including stopped ones):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### 2.4. Stopping and Removing Containers

Stop a running container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

Remove a container:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

### 2.5. Docker Images

List all Docker images:

```bash
docker images
```

Remove a Docker image:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

### 2.6. Building a Docker Image

Let's create a simple Node.js application and Dockerize it.

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`:**

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Node.js image.
   FROM node:14

   # Create and set the working directory.
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json files.
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies.
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code.
   COPY . .

   # Expose the application port.
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Start the application.
   CMD ["node", "index.js"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

### 2.7. Running a Docker Container

Run the container from the image you just built:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

This maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of your machine.

### 2.8. Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**

   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   services:
     app:
       image: my-node-app
       ports:
         - '3000:3000'
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### 2.9. Pushing Images to Docker Hub

1. **Log in to Docker Hub:**

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag your image:**

   ```bash
   docker tag my-node-app your-dockerhub-username/my-node-app
   ```

3. **Push the image:**
   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-node-app
   ```

## 3. Conclusion

Docker simplifies application deployment by creating lightweight, portable containers. With the commands and examples in this tutorial, you're now equipped to start using Docker in your development workflow. Happy Dockerizing!
