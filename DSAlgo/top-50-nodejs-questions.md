Here’s a list of **50 frequently asked Node.js questions**, each with a detailed answer. These questions cover a broad range of topics, from basic Node.js concepts to more advanced and practical aspects.

---

### 1. **What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It uses Chrome’s V8 engine to execute JavaScript code and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for handling asynchronous operations.

---

### 2. **What are the key features of Node.js?**

- **Asynchronous and Event-driven**: All APIs in Node.js are asynchronous (non-blocking).
- **Single-threaded**: Node.js operates on a single thread using event looping.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Operations are non-blocking, which improves performance.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

### 3. **What is the difference between `require` and `import`?**

- **`require()`**: CommonJS module system used in Node.js for importing modules.
- **`import`**: ES6 module system, newer but not yet fully supported in all Node.js versions unless explicitly enabled.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs'); // CommonJS
import fs from 'fs'; // ES6 (if supported or using `"type": "module"` in package.json)
```

---

### 4. **What is the Event Loop in Node.js?**

The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite being single-threaded. It offloads I/O tasks to the system kernel, which allows Node.js to handle multiple requests without waiting for previous ones to complete.

---

### 5. **What are global objects in Node.js?**

Global objects are available in all modules without the need to import them. Some examples include:

- `__dirname`: Directory name of the current module.
- `__filename`: Filename of the current module.
- `process`: Information about the current Node.js process.
- `global`: Global namespace object.

---

### 6. **What is `package.json`?**

`package.json` is the configuration file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project (like name, version, description) and lists dependencies, scripts, and other configuration options required to manage the project.

---

### 7. **What is npm?**

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, update, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies for Node.js projects.

---

### 8. **What is the difference between `npm` and `npx`?**

- **`npm`**: Used to manage packages, i.e., installing and updating Node.js packages.
- **`npx`**: Allows you to execute npm packages directly without installing them globally.

---

### 9. **What is a callback in Node.js?**

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. In Node.js, callbacks are commonly used for handling asynchronous tasks. After the async task completes, the callback function is invoked.

Example:

```js
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

---

### 10. **What is middleware in Node.js?**

Middleware is a function that has access to the request and response objects in an Express.js application. It can modify the request or response and decide whether to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

Example of middleware in Express:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware triggered');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});
```

---

### 11. **What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js?**

`module.exports` is used to export functions, objects, or primitives from a module so they can be used in another module using `require()`.

Example:

```js
// module.js
module.exports = function () {
  console.log('Exported function');
};

// app.js
const exportedFunction = require('./module');
exportedFunction();
```

---

### 12. **What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code in Node.js?**

- **Blocking**: The program stops execution until the operation completes.
- **Non-blocking**: The program can continue execution while the operation completes in the background.

Example of blocking:

```js
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');
console.log(data);
```

Example of non-blocking:

```js
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

---

### 13. **What is `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**

`process.nextTick()` schedules a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O tasks. It is used to defer the execution of a callback until the current call stack is cleared.

---

### 14. **What is `streams` in Node.js?**

Streams are objects that enable reading or writing data piece by piece (chunks), rather than all at once. Streams are useful for handling large files or data.

Types of streams:

- **Readable streams**: Read data sequentially (e.g., file reading).
- **Writable streams**: Write data sequentially (e.g., file writing).
- **Duplex streams**: Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP socket).
- **Transform streams**: Modify data while reading or writing (e.g., gzip compression).

---

### 15. **What is the difference between `readFile()` and `createReadStream()`?**

- **`readFile()`**: Reads the entire file into memory and is suitable for small files.
- **`createReadStream()`**: Reads the file in chunks and is used for handling large files.

---

### 16. **What is clustering in Node.js?**

Clustering is a technique that allows Node.js to create multiple worker processes that share the same server port. It allows you to take advantage of multi-core systems by distributing load across all CPU cores.

---

### 17. **What is the `buffer` in Node.js?**

Buffers are used to handle binary data in Node.js. They are mainly used in file system operations, network operations, or working with streams that deal with binary data.

Example:

```js
const buffer = Buffer.from('Hello World');
console.log(buffer.toString()); // Output: Hello World
```

---

### 18. **What is the difference between `Buffer` and `Stream` in Node.js?**

- **Buffer**: Holds the entire data in memory and processes it all at once.
- **Stream**: Processes data in chunks, which makes it suitable for large data.

---

### 19. **What is a Reactor Pattern in Node.js?**

The Reactor Pattern is an event-driven pattern used to handle I/O operations asynchronously. In Node.js, it is implemented using the event loop and callback mechanism.

---

### 20. **What are the core modules of Node.js?**

Some core modules are:

- `http`: Used to create HTTP servers.
- `fs`: File system operations.
- `path`: Utilities for file paths.
- `os`: Operating system-related utilities.
- `crypto`: Cryptographic operations.
- `stream`: Stream handling.

---

### 21. **What is Express.js in Node.js?**

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies routing, middleware, and request handling.

---

### 22. **What is middleware in Express.js?**

Middleware functions in Express are functions that have access to the request and response objects and the `next()` function. They execute code, modify the request/response objects, or end the request-response cycle.

---

### 23. **What is the difference between `res.send()` and `res.json()` in Express.js?**

- **`res.send()`**: Sends a response with any type of data (HTML, plain text, JSON, etc.).
- **`res.json()`**: Sends a JSON response. It automatically sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

---

### 24. **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?**

You can handle file uploads in Node.js using libraries like `multer`. It processes `multipart/form-data`, which is used for uploading files.

Example:

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```

---

### 25. **What is CORS in Node.js?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that restricts web applications from making requests to a domain different from the one the application originated from. In Node.js, you can handle CORS using the `cors` middleware.

---

### 26. **What is a REST API in Node.js?**

A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an API that follows REST principles, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

---

### 27. **What is the purpose of `process.env` in Node.js?**

`process.env` is used to access environment variables in Node.js. It is often used to store sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and other configuration details.

---

### 28. **What is `async`/`await` in Node.js?**

`
