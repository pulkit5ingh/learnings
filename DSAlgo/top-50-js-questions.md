Here is a list of the **top 50 most frequently asked JavaScript questions**, along with detailed answers:

---

### 1. **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create dynamic web pages. It is widely used for both client-side (in browsers) and server-side (with environments like Node.js) development.

---

### 2. **What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?**

- **String**: Represents textual data.
- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.
- **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
- **Symbol**: Introduced in ES6, used for unique identifiers.
- **BigInt**: For representing integers larger than the maximum limit for a number.

---

### 3. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

- **`==` (Loose Equality)**: Compares two values for equality, but performs type conversion if they are of different types.
- **`===` (Strict Equality)**: Compares both the value and the type without type conversion.

Example:

```js
'5' == 5; // true
'5' === 5; // false
```

---

### 4. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**

A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. It allows functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created.

Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const increment = outer();
console.log(increment()); // 1
console.log(increment()); // 2
```

---

### 5. **What is `this` in JavaScript?**

`this` refers to the object that the current function is executing within. The value of `this` depends on the context in which the function is called.

- In a global function, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers).
- Inside a method, `this` refers to the object that owns the method.

---

### 6. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**

- **`var`**: Function-scoped. It can be redeclared and redefined.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped. It cannot be redeclared but can be redefined.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped. It cannot be redeclared or redefined.

---

### 7. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**

Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage events triggered by its children. This takes advantage of event bubbling, where events propagate from the target element up through the DOM hierarchy.

---

### 8. **What are Promises in JavaScript?**

Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

Example:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Success'), 1000);
});
promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
```

---

### 9. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?**

- **Synchronous code**: Executes sequentially, one task at a time.
- **Asynchronous code**: Executes non-sequentially, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously (e.g., using `setTimeout`, Promises, or async/await).

---

### 10. **What is the `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` method in JavaScript?**

- **`call()`**: Calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are provided as an array.
- **`bind()`**: Creates a new function with `this` bound to a specific object and does not immediately invoke the function.

---

### 11. **What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?**

An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It's often used to create a local scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.

Example:

```js
(function () {
  console.log('IIFE runs immediately');
})();
```

---

### 12. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**

Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope during the compilation phase. This applies to function and `var` declarations, though `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized.

---

### 13. **What are arrow functions in JavaScript?**

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for function expressions and do not bind their own `this`, which makes them ideal for callbacks or methods inside objects.

Example:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

---

### 14. **What is the spread operator (`...`)?**

The spread operator is used to expand iterables (like arrays or objects) into individual elements.

Example:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

### 15. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

Example:

```js
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const { name, age } = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
```

---

### 16. **What are template literals?**

Template literals are a way to work with strings, allowing for embedding expressions and multiline strings. They are enclosed in backticks `` ` ``.

Example:

```js
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

---

### 17. **What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()`?**

- **`slice()`**: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, without modifying the original array.
- **`splice()`**: Modifies the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.

---

### 18. **What is the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?**

The `typeof` operator is used to check the type of a variable.

Example:

```js
typeof 'hello'; // "string"
typeof 42; // "number"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof {}; // "object"
```

---

### 19. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

- **`undefined`**: Indicates a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **`null`**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

---

### 20. **What is event bubbling in JavaScript?**

Event bubbling is the propagation of an event from the target element to its parent elements, eventually reaching the root of the DOM tree. It allows handling an event at any point in the hierarchy.

---

### 21. **What is memoization in JavaScript?**

Memoization is an optimization technique where the result of a function call is cached based on its arguments, allowing subsequent calls with the same arguments to return the cached result without re-executing the function.

---

### 22. **What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?**

A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result. Examples include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

---

### 23. **What is `NaN` in JavaScript?**

`NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a special value returned when a mathematical operation results in an undefined or unrepresentable value.

---

### 24. **What is the difference between `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`?**

- **`setTimeout()`**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.
- **`setInterval()`**: Repeatedly executes a function at regular intervals until it is stopped.

---

### 25. **What is the difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?**

- **`map()`**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
- **`filter()`**: Returns a new array with only the elements that pass a test.
- **`reduce()`**: Reduces an array to a single value by accumulating the result of applying a function to each element.

---

### 26. **What is a promise chain in JavaScript?**

A promise chain is a series of `.then()` calls on a promise where each step depends on the result of the previous step.

Example:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

---

### 27. **What is `async/await` in JavaScript?**

`async/await` is syntactic sugar over promises. An `async` function always returns a promise, and `await` pauses execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.

---

### 28. **What is a pure function?**

A pure function is a function that always returns the same result for the same inputs and has no side effects (does not modify external variables or objects).

---

Continuing from where you left off:

---

### 29. **What is an event loop in JavaScript?**

The **event loop** is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous code (like callbacks, promises, and timers) to be executed in a non-blocking manner. It continuously checks the call stack and the message queue, executing tasks from the message queue when the call stack is empty.

---

### 30. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript?**

- **Synchronous JavaScript**: Code is executed line-by-line, and each line must finish before the next one runs. It blocks the execution of further code until the current operation completes.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Code allows other operations to be executed while waiting for non-blocking tasks (like I/O operations, network requests) to complete. It uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle these tasks.

---

### 31. **What is the difference between `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`?**

- **`setTimeout()`**: Executes a function after a specified delay (once).
- **`setInterval()`**: Repeatedly executes a function with a specified delay between each call.

Example:

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log('This runs after 1 second'), 1000);
setInterval(() => console.log('This runs every 2 seconds'), 2000);
```

---

### 32. **What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?**

- **`call()`**: Calls a function with a specific `this` value and individual arguments.
- **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but takes an array of arguments.
- **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with `this` bound to the provided context and arguments, but doesn't invoke the function immediately.

---

### 33. **What is the purpose of the `Object.assign()` method?**

`Object.assign()` is used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.

Example:

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1 };
const obj2 = { b: 2 };
const mergedObj = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
console.log(mergedObj); // { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

---

### 34. **What is the `prototype` in JavaScript?**

Every JavaScript object has a `prototype`. The `prototype` is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Prototypes are part of the inheritance mechanism in JavaScript, allowing objects to access methods defined on their prototype chain.

---

### 35. **What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?**

- **Shallow copy**: Copies the first level of the object, but if the object contains nested objects, it copies only the references.
- **Deep copy**: Recursively copies all nested objects, ensuring a completely independent copy.

---

### 36. **What is `use strict` in JavaScript?**

`use strict` is a directive that enables strict mode, a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript. It helps in catching common coding errors like undeclared variables.

Example:

```js
'use strict';
x = 3.14; // Throws an error (x is not declared)
```

---

### 37. **What is memoization in JavaScript?**

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again, thereby reducing computation.

Example:

```js
function memoizedAdd() {
  let cache = {};
  return (n) => {
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n];
    } else {
      const result = n + 10;
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}
const add = memoizedAdd();
console.log(add(10)); // Computes result
console.log(add(10)); // Returns cached result
```

---

### 38. **What is `Promise.all()` in JavaScript?**

`Promise.all()` takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved or when any of them rejects. It allows you to run multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.

Example:

```js
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(values); // Array of results
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // First rejected promise
  });
```

---

### 39. **What is `Promise.race()` in JavaScript?**

`Promise.race()` takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects as soon as any of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects.

---

### 40. **What is the purpose of `try...catch` in JavaScript?**

`try...catch` is used for error handling in JavaScript. Code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an error occurs, control is passed to the `catch` block where the error can be handled gracefully.

Example:

```js
try {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // "Something went wrong"
}
```

---

### 41. **What is `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`?**

- **`JSON.stringify()`**: Converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
- **`JSON.parse()`**: Converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object.

Example:

```js
const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString); // '{"name":"Alice"}'
const parsedObj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsedObj); // { name: 'Alice' }
```

---

### 42. **What is a generator function in JavaScript?**

A generator function is a function that can be paused and resumed, and it returns an iterator object. The `function*` syntax defines a generator function, and the `yield` keyword is used to pause execution.

Example:

```js
function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
const gen = generator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
```

---

### 43. **What is function currying in JavaScript?**

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

Example:

```js
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
const add5 = add(5);
console.log(add5(10)); // 15
```

---

### 44. **What is an object in JavaScript?**

An object is a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods) in JavaScript. Keys are strings (or symbols), and values can be any type (including functions, which become methods).

Example:

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};
person.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice
```

---

### 45. **What is `Array.prototype.reduce()` used for?**

`reduce()` applies a function to an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

Example:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
```

---

### 46. **What is function composition in JavaScript?**

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to create a new function where the output of one function is the input to the next.

Example:

```js
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));
const add1 = (x) => x + 1;
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const add1ThenDouble = compose(double, add1);
console.log(add1ThenDouble(5)); // 12
```

---

### 47. **What are the different ways to iterate over an array in JavaScript?**

- **`for` loop**
- **`for...of` loop**
- **`forEach()`**
- **`map()`**
- **`reduce()`**
- **`filter()`**

---

### 48. **What is the difference between `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()`?**

- **`map()`**: Creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element.
- **`forEach()`**: Executes a function for each element but does not return a new array.

---

### 49. **What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects in JavaScript?**

- **Mutable objects**: Their state can be modified after they are created (e.g., objects, arrays).
- **Immutable objects**: Their state cannot be changed once they are created (e.g., primitive values like strings, numbers).

---

### 50. **What are JavaScript Promises, and what problem do they solve?**

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They allow you to attach handlers for eventual success (`.then()`) or failure (`.catch()`) of asynchronous operations, improving code readability over callbacks.
