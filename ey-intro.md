### projects

1. Here’s the updated Tripinnov project description with the latest details:

- Tripinnov is a multi-tenant, multi-portal travel platform designed for travel agents to create and sell travel quotations on the go.

- In the frontend we have used Turborepo and followed monorepo architecture to maintain
  multiple dashboards with landing pages.

- In the backend we have used nest js to build apis with mongodb as a database.

- In this project i have lead the team of 2 frontend and 1 backend developer where
  we have solved and implemented multiple following problems

- Authentication and Authorization: Built a dynamically configurable RBAC system: Implemented
  role-based authentication and authorization using PassportJS and JWT with a dynamically configurable RBAC
  (Role-Based Access Control) system, allowing flexible and granular access management with robust authentication
  mechanisms.

- Notifications Mail and SMS System using NodeMailer and Twilio API: Developed a comprehensive
  service for sending email and SMS for OTP and other notifications for users.

- Statistics and Reports: Integrated highly scalable MongoDB aggregation queries to
  generate comprehensive reports and statistics from stored data for various roles, with the capability to export this data in multiple formats.
  The reports can be queried by date, month, year, and many other parameters, providing flexible and detailed
  insights.

- Bulk Task: Built a bulk upload task system which processes an Excel sheet, uploads the correct data, and rejects incorrect data with proper validation messages in the same Excel sheet using BullMQ and Redis.

- Payment Gateways: Utilized PhonePe’s and Easebuzz’s payment gateway APIs with webhooks to facilitate seamless money transactions.

- User Subscription: Integrated subscription models and reminders, offering a range of options including trial, monthly, half-yearly, and yearly plans.

- PDF Generator using Puppeteer and Handlebars Template Engine: Created a PDF generation tool to produce customized PDFs for OTP, resetting passwords, quotations, billing, and many other templates.

- Media Uploads and Downloads: Extensively utilized AWS S3 for storing, updating, and retrieving media files.

- Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation for backend APIs using both Swagger and Postman.

- For version control, we used Git and GitHub, while CI/CD pipelines were set up via GitHub Actions to ensure smooth, automated deployments and continuous integration. This setup enabled robust, real-time data interaction and seamless travel quotation management for agents.
