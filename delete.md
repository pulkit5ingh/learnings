It's inspiring to learn about your vision to help those suffering from starvation in rural villages and your efforts to organize the sector through technology.

Additionally, I would like to take on a leadership role in the technical team to ensure we build a robust and effective system.

I do value recognition for my contributions and would like to ensure that my work is credited appropriately.

Let's connect and discuss how we can move forward together to make this vision a reality.
