Hi Yadara,

Thank you for your email. I’m happy to provide details about my experience and availability:

Development Experience:
I have over 4 years of experience in software development, focusing primarily on backend development and API integrations. I’ve worked on a variety of projects, including e-commerce platforms, travel applications, and internal tools. My experience encompasses both building new applications and maintaining existing systems, with a strong emphasis on optimizing performance and ensuring code quality.

Node.js Experience:
I have been working with Node.js for over 4 years. I’ve developed and maintained several Node.js applications, including RESTful APIs and microservices. My expertise includes using popular frameworks and libraries such as Express.js, Sequelize, and Mongoose, as well as implementing best practices for asynchronous programming, error handling, and scalability.

Open API Experience:
I have experience working with OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for designing and documenting APIs. I’ve used OpenAPI specifications to define API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods. This has enabled me to create comprehensive API documentation and facilitate communication between frontend and backend teams.

GraphQL Experience:
I have worked with GraphQL to design and implement flexible APIs. My experience includes setting up GraphQL servers using Apollo Server and integrating them with various data sources. I’ve utilized GraphQL to provide clients with efficient data querying capabilities, optimize response payloads, and manage schema evolution.

Availability to Commence Work:
I am available to commence work starting from next week

Required Hourly Rate:
My required hourly rate is 1500. I am open to discussing this based on the project scope and requirements.

Hours Per Week Available to Work:
I am available to work 40, depending on the project needs and deadlines.

Regards,
Pulkit
