## üìö Introduction

## Javascript code execution Overview

- JS is single-threaded and synchronous.
- Components: Call Stack, Heap, Event Loop.
- Phases: Creation ‚Üí Execution.
- Concepts: Execution Context, Memory Heap.

---

## üéØ Key Concepts

- **JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language**.
  - **Synchronous**: Executes one task at a time in a specific order.
  - **Single-threaded**: Only **one line of code** can be executed at any moment.

> ‚ùì What about `asynchronous` like AJAX?
> ‚û°Ô∏è That involves **other concepts** like **Web APIs**, **Callback Queue**, and **Event Loop**, which we‚Äôll learn separately.

---

## üß© Quick Example

```js
console.log('1');
console.log('2');
console.log('3');
```

Output:

```js
1;
2;
3;
```

Runs top to bottom in one thread.

## üß† What is an Execution Context?

The Execution Context has **two main components**:

1. **Memory Component (Variable Environment)**

   - All **variables** and **functions** are stored here as **key-value pairs**.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var a = 10;
     function greet() {
       console.log('Hello');
     }
     ```
     Memory stores:
     ```
     a: 10
     greet: function() { console.log("Hello"); }
     ```

2. **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**
   - The place where code is **executed one line at a time**.
   - It's like a thread moving line-by-line through your code.

---

## Thread of Execution

- The flow in which code executes line-by-line.

---

## JS Code Execution Flow

1. Global Execution Context Created
2. Memory Creation Phase:
   - Variables hoisted (var ‚Üí undefined)
   - Functions hoisted fully
3. Execution Phase:
   - Code runs line-by-line

---

## Memory Environment & Code Component

- **Memory/Variable Environment:** Holds vars/functions
- **Code Component (Thread):** Executes logic

---

## üìù Recap

- Execution Context : Big box where JS code runs.
- Memory Component : Stores variables/functions (variable environment).
- Code Component : Executes code line-by-line (thread of execution).
- Synchronous : One task at a time, in order.
- Single-threaded : Only one line running at a time.

---

## Hoisting in JavaScript

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

Function declaration hoisted with body:

```js
foo(); // "Hello"
function foo() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
```

Function expression not hoisted:

```js
bar(); // TypeError
var bar = function () {};
```

---

## Function vs Variable Invocation

- **Function invocation:** `foo()`
- **Variable invocation:** `console.log(x)`

---

## What Happens on an Empty JS File?

- Global Execution Context created
- `this === window` is true
- No output or error

---

## Window & This Keyword

- In global scope:
  - `this` refers to `window`
  - `var` declared variables attach to `window`

---

## Defined vs Undefined

- **Defined:** Assigned a value
- **Undefined:** Declared but no value assigned

```js
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
```

---

## Scope, Scope Chain & Lexical Environment

- **Scope:** Access region for variables/functions
- **Scope Chain:** Nested chain of parent scopes
- **Lexical Environment:** Code + memory context

---

## var, let, const Differences

| Feature       | `var`             | `let`           | `const`         |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Scope         | Function scope    | Block scope     | Block scope     |
| Hoisting      | Yes (`undefined`) | Yes (TDZ error) | Yes (TDZ error) |
| Reassignment  | Yes               | Yes             | No              |
| Redeclaration | Yes               | No              | No              |

---

## Errors: SyntaxError vs ReferenceError vs TypeError

- **SyntaxError:** Bad syntax
  ```js
  var a = ; // SyntaxError
  ```
- **ReferenceError:** Accessing undeclared variable
  ```js
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError
  ```
- **TypeError:** Wrong operation on value type
  ```js
  null(); // TypeError: null is not a function
  ```

---

## Block, Compound Statement, Scope & Shadowing

- **Block:** `{ ... }`
- **Compound Statement:** Multiple statements in a block
- **Scope:** Context for variable access
- **Shadowing:** Inner variable with same name as outer

```js
let x = 1;
{
  let x = 2; // shadows outer x
}
```

---

## Closures in JavaScript

- A closure is when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even when run outside it.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```
